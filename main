What is a Servo Motor?

A servo motor is a type of motor that rotates within a limited angle (usually 0Â° to 180Â°).
It is controlled by a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal.

Common hobby servo: SG90 (9g) or MG995.
Inside it has:
A DC motor
A gearbox
A feedback potentiometer
A control circuit

ðŸ”¹ Why Use Servo Motors?
Precise position control.
Low power and easy to control with Arduino.
Common in:RC cars, boats, airplanes Robotics arms DIY automation projects
